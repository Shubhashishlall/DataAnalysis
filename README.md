# Python Diwali Sales Analysis

This project analyzes Diwali sales data to uncover customer behavior patterns and improve both customer experience and sales performance. It also demonstrates how to create various visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python.


# Objectives

* Explore and visualize sales data.
* Compare purchasing patterns between male and female customers.
* Learn and apply different chart types using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

# Steps & Techniques Used

1. Data Cleaning

   * Handled missing values with `.dropna()` and `.isnull()`.
   * Aggregated data using `.sum()` and `.groupby()`.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Created count plots and bar plots using Seaborn.
   * Sorted and grouped data for better insights.
   * Compared product purchases across gender and occupation categories.


#Libraries Used

* **pandas** — data manipulation & cleaning
* **seaborn** — statistical data visualization
* **matplotlib** — general plotting


# Key Insights

* Buying patterns differ significantly between male and female customers.
* Certain occupations and age groups dominate sales during Diwali.
